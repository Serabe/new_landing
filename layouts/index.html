                    <p>Apart from the personal communication held with developers, all other processes in source{d} are automatized. We have a Code Analysis tool that extracts different features from the open source code available on GitHub, detecting language usage, number of repositories, commits, as well as any code related to more than 150 common use frameworks.</p>

                    <p>All these features are then processed, giving us an overview of the developer's professional profile, and updated weekly with the feedback received from the developers we have contacted, as well as their ongoing contributions to open source.</p>

                    <p>Because source{d} is designed by developers, we have drawn out a recruitment process that we, ourselves, would like to be part of. We strongly believe that recruitment can be done right, using publicly available data, and we are trying our best to create an intelligent, friendly, job recommendation service based on facts, and not hunches.</p>

                    <p>source{d} matching algorithms use the code features extracted by code analyzers to match engineers with our open job offers. The matching takes into account an estimation of the professional experience, which we model by creating internal ranks for each language and framework we detect.</p>

<p>Apart from the purely technical information, we also try to enrich our matching using information publicly available on professional networks such as LinkedIn. We place a lot of effort in extracting relevant information such as expected roles, salary or relocation preferences in order to only recommend relevant jobs.</p>

<p>Our matching algorithm runs independently for each job offer, providing us with a list of recommended profiles. We contact the suggested engineers only after identifying that they have the right experience and background.</p>

                    <p>If you are interested in the offer, our Developer Relations team will ask specific questions about your work experience that will directly relate to the offer, followed by a short call through which we will answer any further questions you may have. </p>

<p>Based on the call and your previous experiences, we will come to an informed conclusion with regards to your profile. You are able to stop the process at any point in time if the offer no longer interests you.</p>

<p>Following a successful interview, we write a report summarizing your skills and highlighting your relevant experience for the position. This report is presented to the company. If the company agrees and would like to meet you, we introduce you via email. We maintain contact with you and the company in order to offer assistance where necessary. </p>

<p>If the interview is unsuccessful or you no longer find the offer interesting, we will ask about your working preferences in order to find a better offer for you in the future. If at any stage of the process you decide against further contact, we will exclude you from future searches and offers.
